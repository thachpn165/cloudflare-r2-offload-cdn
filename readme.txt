2. Enter the token in the CDN tab
3. Click "Deploy Worker" button

= WP-CLI Commands =

The plugin provides WP-CLI commands for automation and bulk operations:

`wp cfr2 status`
Show offload statistics (total, offloaded, not offloaded, disk saveable, pending).

`wp cfr2 offload <id|all> [--dry-run] [--batch-size=50]`
Offload media to R2. Use specific ID or "all" for bulk offload.

`wp cfr2 restore <id|all> [--dry-run] [--batch-size=50]`
Restore media from R2 (removes R2 metadata, reverts to local URLs).

`wp cfr2 free-space <id|all> [--dry-run] [--batch-size=50]`
Delete local files for offloaded media to free disk space.

**Examples:**

    # Check current offload status
    wp cfr2 status

    # Offload single attachment
    wp cfr2 offload 123

    # Offload all media with larger batch size
    wp cfr2 offload all --batch-size=100

    # Preview what would be offloaded (dry run)
    wp cfr2 offload all --dry-run

    # Free disk space by removing local copies
    wp cfr2 free-space all
